  abstract = {The structure and dynamics of froths have been subjects of intense interest owing to the desire to understand the behaviour of complex systems where topological intricacy prohibits exact evaluation of the ground state. The dynamics of a traditional froth involves drainage and drying at the cell boundaries; thus, it is irreversible. Here, we report a new member of the froth family: suprafroth, in which the cell boundaries are superconducting and the cell interior is normal, or non-superconducting. Despite having a very different microscopic origin, topological analysis of the structure of the suprafroth shows that the same statistical laws, such as those of von Neumann and of Lewis apply to a suprafroth. Furthermore, for the first time in the analysis of froths, there is a global measurable property, the magnetic moment, which can be directly related to the suprafroth structure. We propose that this suprafroth is a model system for the analysis of the complex physics of two-dimensional froths-with magnetic field and temperature as external (reversible) control parameters.},

  abstract = {We experimentally study the coarsening of two-dimensional cellular domain patterns in an increasing bias field. As in soap froths and polycrystalline materials, the coarsening is driven by effective cell surface energy. We find that the domain patterns are distinguished by a nonmonotonic change in the total cell surface energy and by topological evolution that proceeds almost exclusively by cell elimination. Aboav’s law describing topological correlations between neighboring cells is found to hold over a wide range of bias and cell density. We have also evaluated the distribution P(n) of n-sided cells over three decades in cell density. The patterns show a form of partial scaling: over a two-decade drop in cell density, the fraction of all cells that are pentagonal bubble traps (fivefold symmetric domain structures containing trapped magnetic bubbles) remains nearly constant at f5≊0.2 while P(n) changes rapidly. The partial scaling may be related to a novel topological structure in which the bubble traps act as stable fivefold vertices.},

  abstract = {Granular materials are ubiquitous in our daily lives. While they have been the subject of intensive engineering research for centuries, in the last two decades granular matter has attracted significant attention from physicists. Yet despite major efforts by many groups, the theoretical description of granular systems remains largely a plethora of different, often contradictory concepts and approaches. Various theoretical models have emerged for describing the onset of collective behavior and pattern formation in granular matter. This review surveys a number of situations in which nontrivial patterns emerge in granular systems, elucidates important distinctions between these phenomena and similar ones occurring in continuum fluids, and describes general principles and models of pattern formation in complex systems that have been successfully applied to granular systems.},

The asymptotic relaxation is characterized by two distinct time scales with the longer stemming from the influence of a long-lived diagonal stripe defect.

Surprisingly, the ground state is generally not reached for zero initial magnetization. In two dimensions, the system reaches either a frozen stripe state with probability $\simeq 1/3$ or the ground state with probability $\simeq 2/3$. In greater than two dimensions, the probability of reaching the ground state or a frozen state rapidly vanishes as the system size increases; instead the system wanders forever in an isoenergy set of metastable states. An external magnetic field changes the situation drastically--in two dimensions the favorable ground state is always reached, while in three dimensions the field must exceed a threshold value to reach the ground state. For small but nonzero temperature, relaxation to the final state proceeds first by formation of very long-lived metastable states, as in the zero-temperature case, before equilibrium is reached.}

  abstract = {We live on and among the by-products of fragmentation, from nanoparticles to rock falls to glaciers to continents. Understanding and taming fragmentation is central to assessing natural hazards and extracting resources, and even for landing probes safely on other planetary bodies. In this study, we draw inspiration from an unlikely and ancient source: Plato, who proposed that the element Earth is made of cubes because they may be tightly packed together. We demonstrate that this idea is essentially correct: Appropriately averaged properties of most natural 3D fragments reproduce the topological cube.
 We use mechanical and geometric models to explain the ubiquity of Plato{\textquoteright}s cube in fragmentation and to uniquely map distinct fragment patterns to their formative stress conditions.Plato envisioned Earth's building blocks as cubes, a shape rarely found in nature. The solar system is littered, however, with distorted polyhedra{\textemdash}shards of rock and ice produced by ubiquitous 
fragmentation. We apply the theory of convex mosaics to show that the average geometry of natural two-dimensional (2D) fragments, from mud cracks to Earth{\textquoteright}s tectonic plates, has two attractors:
 {\textquotedblleft}Platonic{\textquotedblright} quadrangles and {\textquotedblleft}Voronoi{\textquotedblright} hexagons. In three dimensions (3D), the Platonic attractor is dominant: Remarkably, the average shape of natural rock fragments is cuboid. When viewed through the lens of convex mosaics, natural fragments are indeed geometric shadows of Plato{\textquoteright}s forms. Simulations show that generic binary breakup drives all mosaics toward the Platonic attractor, explaining the ubiquity of cuboid averages. Deviations from binary fracture produce more exotic patterns that are genetically linked to the formative stress field. We compute the universal pattern generator establishing this link, for 2D and 3D fragmentation.Shape and mass data for all measured 3D rock fragments, including both the small and large experimental datasets, are freely available at https://osf.io/h2ezc/. All code for the geometric simulations{\textemdash}i.e., the cut and break models{\textemdash}is free to download from https://github.com/torokj/Geometric_fragmentation.},

  abstract = {The experiment consists of counting and measuring the size of the many fragments observed after the fall of a mercury drop on the floor. The size distribution follows a power-law for large enough fragments. We address the question of a possible crossover to a second, different power-law for small enough fragments. Two series of experiments were performed. The first uses a traditional film photographic camera, and the picture is later treated on a computer in order to count the fragments and classify them according to their sizes. The second uses a modern digital camera. The first approach has the advantage of a better resolution for small fragment sizes. The second, although with a poorer size resolution, is more reliable concerning the counting of all fragments up to its resolution limit. Both together clearly indicate the real existence of the quoted crossover. The model treats the system microscopically during the tiny time interval when the initial drop collides with the floor. The drop is modelled by a connected cluster of Ising spins pointing up (mercury) surrounded by Ising spins pointing down (air). The Ising coupling which tends to keep the spins segregated represents the surface tension. Initially the cluster carries an extra energy equally shared among all its spins, corresponding to the coherent kinetic energy due to the fall. Each spin which touches the floor loses its extra energy transformed into a thermal, incoherent energy represented by a temperature used then to follow the dynamics through Monte Carlo simulations. Whenever a small piece becomes disconnected from the big cluster, it is considered a fragment, and counted. The results also indicate the existence of the quoted crossover in the fragment-size distribution.},

  abstract = {The approach to equilibrium of ordered superlattice structures on surfaces is analyzed. Both Monte Carlo methods as well as analytic models of interacting domain walls are used to study the kinetics of quenched, two-dimensional systems with Q degenerate equilibrium states. In particular, the growth of long-range order in the magnetic analogs (Q-component Potts models) of the commensurate superlattice structures found on surfaces is analyzed in a study of the kinetics of typical domain geometries that are found when systems are quenched from high (disordered state) to low temperatures. Calculations and simulations of the time and temperature dependence of the domain sizes for the model system of isolated domains indicate that for two dimensions roughening fluctuations of the domain walls strongly influence the grain growth kinetics. Strip-shaped domains approach equilibrium almost entirely through these fluctuations, while circular domains shrink due to deterministic curvature, but with a rate that is strongly temperature dependent even for temperatures outside the critical region. Pinning effects in systems with Q>=3 lead to extremely slow kinetics for particular domain geometries. Low-temperature quenches on a triangular lattice indicate that these pinned geometries are rarely nucleated, while quenches on a square lattice equilibrate much more slowly due to pinning. The application of the theory to superlattice grain growth on surfaces is discussed in the following paper which presents results for the kinetics of quenched systems in terms of the simple domain geometries examined here.},
